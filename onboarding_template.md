*This is an list to consider as you're putting together onboarding documents for your research group. The headers below suggest categories that might become separate documents depending on what makes most sense for your group's needs, priorities, and existing content. It's likely you will have a collection of documents that you can link in between to keep organized: see examples listed in the [README](https://github.com/openscapes/how_we_work#how-we-work).*

- Lab meetings, 1:1 meetings
  - times & places
  - norms, agendas/notes
- A “map” of where to find reagents/equipment-- where are our lab spaces, where are established working protocols stored
- Safety training
  - How to login (virtually)
  - How often to renew
- List of required reading/protocols: these are what you have to know
  - How to dishwash, how to use the autoclave, how to order lab supplies
  - Have these be accessible and editable so the current person onboarding can update and clarify for the future onboarding
