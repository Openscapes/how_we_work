*   **To Do List / Quickstart / Onboarding**
    *   Software accounts and set up, required reading
    *    A “map” of where to find reagents/equipment-- where are our lab spaces, where are established working protocols stored
    *   Safety training for wetlab
        *   How to login to do safety training (virtually)
        *   How often to renew
    *   List of protocols: these are what you have to know
        *   How to dishwash
        *   Use the autoclave
        *   Basic ordering to order supplies (can't go into physical stores on campus)
    *   Software, meetings, norms 
        *   E.g. google groups, Slack, GitHub Org/Issues, frequency of group and 1:1 meetings
        *   Google drive folders, calendars
    *   Remote drives and how to access them via VPN
        *   How to use VPNs
    *   (a start of this in emails that I forward)
    *   List of abbreviations & jargons that our lab uses / Glossary
        *   Going through our old papers and making notes
        *   Blood brain barrier vs neurovascular unit 
    *   
*   **Our values**
    *   Values, inclusion: 
    *   Code of Conduct
    *   How to get support
        *   university specific resources
    *   Be ok with imperfection! Failing is ok! Trust
*   **Data management & shared resources**
    *   Storage & documentation
    *   References management
    *   
    *   Repo for all qualifying exams, prelims, fellowship applications. Diff milestones that people go through in our lab
    *    Communication stuff
    *   
    *   This is how you present scientific work
        *   Journal club templates: this is how you present an article for journal 
        *   Presentations, photos
        *   Poster templates
            *   Advice on how to create posters, present
            *   How to do this virtually rather than printouts
            *   [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/24/theres-movement-better-scientific-posters-are-they-really-better](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/24/theres-movement-better-scientific-posters-are-they-really-better) 
    *    Reference mgmt:
        *   How to download, how to install add-ins for citation managers
        *   Have a small presentation to new students – link 
        *    
    *   Consolidating our storage and docs
        *    Split between dropbox, google drive
        *   Strategies for streamlining. 
        *    Paid subscription? 
            *   Vanderbilt has Dropbox version for free
            *   One issue with consolidation is storage space. Hammell lab has to split across diff places, who has access as an individual. Don't have a good way to have a lab dropbox
        *   Could start with rules: manuscripts here, y there.
        *   Raw data goes on a server. Intermediate/what could be presented and shared go on dropbox
            *   Major roadblock for us to talk about consolidation. 
            *   Diff needs for diff people: Dropbox for some things, not images too big
            *   Requires buy-in from the lab
        *   Some people more happy to share their work/progress. A lot of people not comfortable. Trust, encouragement. Being comfortable with imperfection
        *   Instagram gen: but also I don't know what's going on, 
*   **Computation**
    *   Software, norms for analysis
    *   E.g. scripting, version control
    *   Documentation
    *   
*   

**Create GitHub template! **(Julie screenshares)
